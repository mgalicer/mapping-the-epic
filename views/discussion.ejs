      <h2>The Politics of Mapping in the 21st Century</h2>
      <p>Hanno the Navigator was a Carthaginian admiral famous for his naval pursuits. The locations on this map can be found in his logbook, in which he describes his travel down the West African Coast. The mapping of these locations via modern day tools such as Google Maps presents fascinating issues for the implementer of these maps, as well as those who consume them.</p>

      <p>My process of interpreting the text (which already had it’s own interpretation) and then communicating those ideas to the software interface of Google maps demonstrates that maps are subjective documents shaped by intent and context. When I approached the document of Hanno’s logbook, I was already several degrees removed from the original Greek document reportedly written on a wall. Hanno had several translators with him during his journey, and because the logbook is such a sparse source we can only speculate how accurate they relayed the events that took place, and the description of the geographical places they mention. There are also many nuances of translation that were probably lost to me as an English speaking reader. But perhaps most importantly, the information that I gleaned in order to use for mapping specific places that were mentioned came mostly from Jona Lendering, an academic whose comments and interpretations are included in the web version of the text.</p>

      <p>Given these degrees of separation from the original document, how is it possible to create an accurate map based on this document? This map is a product of two allowances- one: that accuracy can be relative, and isn’t necessarily the objective of the map, and two: that there is room for both human and software interpretation in its digital representation. To create this map, I used Google Maps’ Javascript API, which stands for Application Programming interface. This programmatically exposes some (but not all!) of Google’s software tools for creating maps that I can use to create my own custom map. This includes a service called “geocoding,” an algorithm that takes a text, human-readable address, and translates it into a set of latitude and longitude coordinates. </p>
      <p>Although we often see technology as objective, and human judgement as subjective, this example of mapping demonstrates that human decisions can influence the context and perspective of a map. As a web developer working with this software, I get to set certain parameters using the API, such as the coloring of labeling elements, placement of markers, and where the center should be located. However, what developers gain in the convenience of using this software to do create the many layers of transit, terrain, and places, and do the complex calculations in order to represent data points on it, they sacrifice the knowledge of the inner workings of these algorithms for proprietary reasons. Thus, while we do not know exactly methodology of how latitude and longitude coordinates are chosen, we know that a pair of coordinates does exist - that anyone can view it in the URL of your search. This presents a tension between a conceptual understanding of place and the technological need for precision. The functioning of the geocoding software necessitates that a place, even one such as the Atlas mountain range that we understand as a large geographic area, be assigned coordinates. This assignment ends up being precise, but not necessarily accurate. </p>

      <p>Though Hanno probably wasn’t thinking about the future representation of his journey in digital space as he sailed along the West African coast, he clearly knew that collecting data was important for socio-political reasons. And just as Hanno had translators and his own hand in representing his journey, the software we use on a daily basis reflects the motives of the people who created it. As we move towards a world in which the collection of metadata is increasingly common, we should question the politics and intention behind the abstraction of reality that technology provides us with, and how it shapes our physical and conceptual understanding of the world.
